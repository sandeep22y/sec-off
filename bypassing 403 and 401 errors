Tips on bypassing 403 and 401 errors:

By adding headers:

Use headers such as X-Originating-IP, X-Remote-IP, X-Client-IP, X-Forwarded-For.
These headers take IP addresses as values, and if they match the whitelisted ones, they may grant access.

Using Unicode characters:

Insert Unicode characters to bypass defenses.
Example: % = ca, % = sa, etc.
If /admin is blocked, try accessing %dmin.

By overriding, overwriting URL with headers:

If GET /admin gives a 403 error, try GET /accessible and add one of these HTTP headers:
X-Original-URL: /admin
X-Override-URL: /admin
X-Rewrite-URL: /admin

Try different payloads:

If /admin gives a 403 error, try:
/accessible/../admin
/.;/admin
/admin;/
/admin/~
/./admin/./
/admin?param
/%2e/admin
/admin#

Method switching:

Change the HTTP method from GET to POST to see if it yields different results.

Via IP, Vhost:

Access the site via its IP address or Vhost.
Fuzzing:

Use brute force or fuzzing techniques to explore files or directories further.
